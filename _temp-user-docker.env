# User environment file for use with docker
#
# Format:
#   ENV1=value1
#   ENV2=value2
#
# Note:
# - Consider using tests/_temp_test_settings.bash instead (also supports Github VM Runner).
# - This normally is left empty.
# - It can be used to just specific tests, such as by adding "TEST_REGEX=hello" below.
# - It can also be used to increase the debugging level (e.g., by adding "DEBUG_LEVEL=5" below).
# - Don't use quotes around values (export FU="bar" => FU=bar)

# TODO:
#   TEST_REGEX=pattern
