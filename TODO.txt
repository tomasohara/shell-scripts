Things to do

- Check for duplicate code such as inadvertent merges artifacts. This is
  probably more of an issue with aliases (e.g., tomohara-aliases.bash).
- Add simple example-based tests for common scripts (see simple_batspp.py).
- check for stupid Perl argument unpacking bugs (e.g., long-standing one in common.perl)
    sub debug_on {
      ## BAD: my($level) = $_;
      my($level) = @_;
      ...
      }
- Prune temporary scripts (e.g., it.perl).
- P2: Clarify when all-tomohara-settings needed.
- P3: Document environment variable usage in main scripts.
- P4: Modernize Bash expressions in scripts (e.g., [ $x = $y ] => [ $x == $y ]).
