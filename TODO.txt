Things to do

- Check for duplicate code such as inadvertent merges artifacts. This is
  probably more of an issue with aliases (e.g., tomohara-aliases.bash).
- Add simple example-based tests for common scripts (see simple_batspp.py).
- check for stupid Perl argument unpacking bugs (e.g., long-standing one in common.perl)
    sub debug_on {
      ## BAD: my($level) = $_;
      my($level) = @_;
      ...
      }
